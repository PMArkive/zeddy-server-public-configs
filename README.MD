# Zeddy Zombie Escape Public Repository

## Info

Public repository containing configs and information about the server. Unfortunately, there is a private repository containing the actual "configs" that people want (eg. stripper, entwatch, vscript, etc.). Reason for making that repository private is because it was made before any intentions of making it public, therefore quite a bit of configs are private or given to us under the agreement to keep it on an ask-to-get basis. I may or may not one day make it public, but for now, that will not be done.

## Requesting Configs

Just ask us, like really. We won't bite, and will more often than not just give you the config (like who needs a private EntWatch or BossHud config lol). If you ask for something that is exclusive to Zeddy or private, I will bring it up with the server manager and maybe give it to you. Otherwise, most of the other stuff are public.
