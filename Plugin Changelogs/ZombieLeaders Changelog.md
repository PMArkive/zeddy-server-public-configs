# Preface
Hello to whoever is reading this. Same as BossHud, this is just a documentation of everything that has been changed so it's easier to keep track of what's going on. I'll update this as time goes on with what has been changed and improved. The main difference between this and BossHud's changed logs is that there is still a lot of room for changes/improvements so there will be a dedicated section talking about the roadmap for the plugin.
